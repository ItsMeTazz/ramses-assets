Assets that The Kingdom supports, and their logos/token information to be fed into the UI.

## How to get your token whitelisted (Icon + searchability)

- Fork the `main` branch
- Go to the `blockchains` folder
- Enter the appropriate chain's folder (e.g. `Arbitrum`)
- Go to the `assets` folder
  - add a `{TOKENADDRESS}.png` of the asset's logo, with dimensions to fix the circle previews on the site. Transparent png's preferred
    `
- In `tokenlist.json` add your token + information, same as the others in the file
- Create the Pull Request and the team will approve/deny your ask shortly.
